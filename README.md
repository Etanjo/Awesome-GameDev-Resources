<h1><i>Svelte</i></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Svelte is a web programming framework that uses a combination of HTML, JS, and CSS.</li>
  <li>It is focused around making components, which are segments of code involving the three languages that can be utilized in other files to streamline the page building process.</li>
  <li>It is set up in such a way that libraries are very common and easy to build/use within the framework.</li>
  <li>Svelte is extremely useful for quickly building functional web pages, including 2d games that are on the simpler side. Svelte, in being a web framework struggles to make high-powered programs and 3d games</li>
  <li>Open Source</li>
